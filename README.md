# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem Definition
The client Mr. K is a student at UWC ISAK and he is a professional archery player.

## Proposed Solution



## Design statement
We will make a poster with all of our progress documented. We will have a system diagram, the materials we used, the set up. And the process of actually programming and running it.  graphs that show the temperature and humidity in mean, standad deviation, minimum, maximum, and median so that the client will understand what the humidity and the temperature in his room is in one glance. We will also add a graph that shows a prediction of the subsequent 12 hours for both temperature and humidity. As a conclusion we will talk about the health effects that this data represents and the effect to the violin as well.

## Success Criteria

1. The application is able to add all the quiptments that Archery Club owns also add new items that was bought.
2. the application also allows you to delete things that are lost or stolen for example.
3. It also shows you the entire item in the inventory in one glance, with all the details nessesary.
